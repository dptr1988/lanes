CHANGE X:

CHANGE 21 (bugfixes) BGe 3-Jan-2011:
    Several fixes by Martin Krpan:
    - linda_send was waiting on the wrong signal
    - buildfix when using i586-mingw32msvc-gcc cross compiler
    - lanes_h:cancel() returns a boolean as it should
    - timers could get blocked sometimes because they were initialized with negative values
    - prepare_timeout could generate an illegal setting

CHANGE 20 BGe 3-Dec-2010:
    Enable to specify a string as lane code instead of a function so that we dont use lua_dump, which
    isn't supported by LuaJIT.

CHANGE 19 BGe 2-Dec-2010:
    No longer rely on global function 'tostring' to generate unique identifiers when caching data being transfered through la linda. Should fix a compatilibity issue with LuaJIT2.

CHANGE 18 BGe 6-Oct-2010:
    Fixed 'memory leak' in some situations where a free running lane is collected before application shutdown
	A bit of code cleanup

CHANGE 17 BGe 21-Sept-2010:
    Fixed stupid compilation errors.

CHANGE 16 PLM 24-Aug-2010:
    Releasing memory at gc / atexit.
    Finalizers actually get error strings.
    Fixed missing argument propagation in lane:cancel
    Added variable threadName sent trough globals-table. Set in s_lane, and in debuggers on windows.
    Added argument checking for linda-objects, where missing them caused crashes.

CHANGE 15 (minor) BGe 27-Jul-2010:
    Version bump for a true upgrade release (2.0.4 package was only a renamed 2.0.3)

CHANGE 14 (bug fix) BGe 09-Jul-2010:
    Fixed lane status to be correctly returned as "waiting" when it should.

CHANGE 13 (fix for multithreaded host apps) AKa 24-Jun-2009:
    <borisusun-at-gmail> mentioned Lanes expects the host application to be singlethreaded,
    and there are troubles if Lanes is used from multiple threads, opened by the host
    (before requiring Lanes). This is true, and fix should now be in place.

CHANGE 12 (bug fix on Windows, 2.0.3) AKa 25-Jan-2009:
    Did CHANGE 9 the way it should be done.

CHANGE 11 (new feature, 2.0.3) AKa 23-Jan-2009:
    Finalizers ('set_finalizer()') for being able to do cleanup of a lane's
    resources, whether it returned succesfully or via an error.

CHANGE 10 (new feature, 2.0.3) AKa 23-Jan-2009:
    Call stack showing where an error occurred is not merged with the error
    message, but delivered as a separate stack table ({ "filename:line" [, ...] }).
    Getting call stacks of errorred lanes is now possible.

CHANGE 9 (bug fix on Windows) AKa 10-Dec-2008 (> 2.0.2):
    Applied patch from Kriss Daniels to avoid issues on 'now_time()' in Win32
    (http://luaforge.net/forum/forum.php?thread_id=22704&forum_id=1781).

CHANGE 8 (bug fix) AKa 26-Oct-2008:
    Avoids occasional segfault at process exit (on multicore CPUs). Does this
    by keeping track of "free running" threads (s.a. the time thread) and
    cancelling them at process exit.

    Tested (2.0.2) on Linux 64,x86, OS X, WinXP.

CHANGE 7 (bug fix) AKa 15-Oct-2008:
    Recursive functions that use themselves as direct upvalue can now be
    passed to other lanes, and used as a lane function.

CHANGE 6 (bug fix) AKa 15-Oct-2008:
    Added local caches of the following to src/lanes.lua (was otherwise getting
    errors at least in 'tests/irayo_recursive.lua').

		local assert= assert
		local string_gmatch= assert( string.gmatch )
		local select= assert( select )
		local type= assert( type )
		local pairs= assert( pairs )
		local tostring= assert( tostring )
		local error= assert( error )
		local setmetatable= assert( setmetatable )
		local rawget= assert( rawget )

    Thanks to Irayo for detecting and reporting this.

CHANGE 5 (new feature):
    Modifying Makefile so it's better suited to LuaRocks.

CHANGE 4 (new feature):
    Metatable copying, allowing Lua objects to be copied across lanes.

CHANGE 3 (bug fix) AKa 5-Aug-2008:
    The '__gc' method was not tied to thread userdata, at all. Caused memory
    lifespan problems at least on OS X when threads were cancelled (EINVAL).

CHANGE 2 (bug fix) AKa 5-Aug-2008:
    Better calculation of timeouts, always making them absolute (even in Win32)
    to allow for events that wake the lane up but don't read/write the Linda
    key that it was observing.

CHANGE 1 (bug fix) AKa 4-Aug-2008:
    Signalling woke up only one waiting thread, not all. This caused i.e.
    receive to not wake up if there was another thread waiting on the same
    Linda object.

    PThread fix: using 'pthread_cond_broadcast()' instead of 'pthread_cond_signal()'
    Win32 fix: using manual events and 'PulseEvent()'

(end)
